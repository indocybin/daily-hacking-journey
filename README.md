# My Daily Ethical Hacking Journey

Goal: Become a financially independent, ethical hacker / penetration tester who travels the U.S. in a van.

This repo documents my daily learning, progress, projects, and notes.

## Why this repo exists
- To build discipline: at least one commit per day.
- To track my growth from beginner → professional.
- To create a public portfolio employers and clients can see.
- To hold myself accountable.

## Roadmap (first version)
- Learn Linux basics
- Study networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP)
- Practice safe & legal hacking labs (TryHackMe, HTB)
- Build small security projects and scripts
- Create writeups for CTFs and labs
- Work toward certifications (eJPT → OSCP)

## Daily Log
I'm tracking progress inside a `daily-log.md` file. Every day I'll update it with:
- Date
- What I studied/worked on
- What I learned
Day 1 — Environment Setup (completed)

Boot into my Linux USB or VM.

Practice core terminal commands (ls, cd, pwd, touch, mkdir, rm).

Update the system (sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade).

Add a quick summary to daily-log.md.

Day 2 — Networking Basics (completed)

Learned TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP fundamentals.

Practiced ipconfig, ping, tracert in Windows.

Logged everything in daily-log.md.

Day 3 — Nmap + Recon Foundations

Install Nmap (sudo apt install nmap).

Scan my own machine/network (nmap -sC -sV <my-ip>).

Note what open ports and services mean.

Add notes in /notes/networking.md.

Day 4 — First Hands-On Lab

Create/continue a TryHackMe account.

Complete the Introduction to Cyber Security room.

Save takeaways + screenshots in /notes/thm/.

Day 5 — Linux Permissions + Processes

Learn file permissions (chmod, chown).

Study processes (ps, top, kill).

Practice simple shell scripting (variables, loops).

Save any scripts in /scripts/.

Day 6 — Build a Simple Security Script

Create a basic Python or Bash tool (ping sweeper, tiny port scanner, etc.).

Commit it even if it’s rough. Progress over perfection.

Day 7 — Weekly Review + Repo Cleanup

Organize folders: /notes/, /scripts/, /ctf-writeups/, daily-log.md.

Write a reflection on what I learned and what’s next.
