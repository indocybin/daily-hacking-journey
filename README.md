# My Daily Ethical Hacking Journey

Goal: Become a financially independent, ethical hacker / penetration tester who travels the U.S. in a van.

This repo documents my daily learning, progress, projects, and notes.

## Why this repo exists
- To build discipline: at least one commit per day.
- To track my growth from beginner → professional.
- To create a public portfolio employers and clients can see.
- To hold myself accountable.

## Roadmap (first version)
- Learn Linux basics
- Study networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP)
- Practice safe & legal hacking labs (TryHackMe, HTB)
- Build small security projects and scripts
- Create writeups for CTFs and labs
- Work toward certifications (eJPT → OSCP)

## Daily Log
I'm tracking progress inside a `daily-log.md` file. Every day I'll update it with:
- Date
- What I studied/worked on
- What I learned
- Still haven't taught myself anything!
